# ExoSpikeNet: Light Curve Analysis Based Spiking Neural Network for Exoplanet Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the code and supplementary materials for the paper *"ExoSpikeNet: A Light Curve Analysis Based Spiking Neural Network for Exoplanet Detection,"* co-authored by Maneet Chatterjee, Anuvab Sen, and Subhabrata Roy. Our research introduces a novel approach using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for classifying exoplanets from light curve data obtained from the Kepler (K2) mission.

## Key Features

- **Spiking Neural Network (SNN) Implementation:** An innovative approach for analyzing light curves and detecting exoplanets.
- **Comparison with Traditional Models:** Performance evaluation against conventional machine learning and deep learning models.
- **Data Processing:** Tools for handling and processing large datasets, including light curves and associated labels.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.
